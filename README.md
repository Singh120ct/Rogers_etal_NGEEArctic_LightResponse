# Rogers_etal_NGEEArctic_LightResponse
R scripts for fitting photosynthetic light response curves and inverting leaf reflectance observations with the PROSPECT-5 leaf radiative transfer model (RTM).  These scripts were used in the development of the Rogers et al. (in prep) manuscript 

## Contains:
